As Baluja approached the weathered wooden door, a sense of familiarity washed over him. The carvings on its surface, a warning etched by his own hand, seemed to whisper secrets from a forgotten past. With a trembling claw, he traced the grooves, and in an instant, a flood of memories rushed through his mind.

The Tower, the countless lives, the endless cycle of redemption â€“ it all came back to him in a dizzying torrent. Baluja staggered back, his eyes wide with revelation. He turned to face the beach, the tranquil scene now imbued with new meaning.

Instinctively, Baluja called out for his companions, their names echoing across the sand. But as the sound of his own voice faded, a realization dawned upon him. This moment, this respite, was fleeting. The multiverse, and those he had sworn to protect, needed him.

With a heavy sigh, Baluja turned back to the door. The weight of his past and the urgency of the present collided within him, and in that moment, he heard the distant call of his party, their voices carried on the wind. They needed his help.

Squaring his shoulders, Baluja strode forward and reached for the door, his scarred hand gripping the handle with a newfound resolve. As he opened the portal, the beach and its warm sunlight faded away, replaced by the cool night air of a dense forest.

Baluja found himself standing before a cabin, its exterior illuminated by the flickering light of torches. The memory of the beach and his revelation slipped from his mind as quickly as it had arrived, leaving only a vague sense of urgency and the knowledge that his companions needed him. With a final glance at the somewhat familiar surroundings, Baluja pressed forward, exclaiming 'Oh look, a cabin!'.

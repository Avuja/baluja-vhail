# Baluja Vhail: A Tale of Redemption and Self-Discovery

## Character Summary

Baluja Vhail, a 38-year-old Tortle Samurai, is a complex character with a mysterious past and a journey of redemption that spans across different planes and time periods. Originally from a simple tribal background, Baluja found himself inexplicably transported to the future plane of Neon Kamigawa at a young age. He initially believed Kamigawa to be the afterlife due to the presence of Kami, but eventually came to view his experiences as a dream, especially after encountering the party's diverse cast of characters and learning about Planeswalking, a power he unknowingly possesses.

Unbeknownst to the party, Baluja's true origin is shrouded in mystery. In his past life, he was the avatar of an evil god, serving as a villainous general in the god's army. After being defeated by a group of good-aligned gods, Baluja was sentenced to an eternal prison in the Tower, a place that connects him to different lives of strife and struggle, each one presenting an opportunity for him to atone for his past misdeeds.

Throughout his countless lives, Baluja finds purpose in fighting for a cause or protecting others, slowly chipping away at the Tower and his own guilt. The recurring motif of the door serves as a powerful symbol, representing the threshold between Baluja's moments of respite on a secluded beach and the trials he must endure. The increasing scars on his body and the passage of time serve as physical reminders of his journey towards redemption.

### DM Notes
- Baluja possesses a haunted doll from Fantasy Costco that can absorb a final failed death saving throw. This is unknown to Angie, who is responsible for making Baluja's death saving throw. When the situation arises, Baluja's player plans to ham it up, as he enjoys tormenting Angie.

As Baluja continues to engage with the future version of Dominaria as part of his Planeswalking adventure, he may start to recognize familiar elements from his time on the beach, leading to moments of déjà vu or triggering flashbacks that provide insight into his true nature and the purpose of his existence.

### DM Notes
- The beach retirement plane could be a far-past version of Dominaria, adding a temporal aspect to Baluja's story.
- The cabin Baluja found on the beach and the one he and his party members arrived at on Dominaria may hold a special significance, acting as a bridge between different phases of his life.
- Gradually reveal more about Baluja's past as the avatar of the evil god, the nature of his imprisonment in the Tower, and the significance of the beach and the door throughout the campaign.

Baluja's story is a testament to the power of redemption, the cyclical nature of existence, and the importance of finding purpose in the face of adversity. His unique backstory and the incorporation of time travel and planar mysteries add depth and intrigue to the character, providing ample opportunities for engaging roleplaying and memorable moments throughout the campaign.
